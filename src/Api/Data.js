    "description": "Did you seriously come to this page to get a description of what League of Legends was? Oh well… if you showed up here I should at least give you the basics. League of Legends is a free-to-play competitive MOBA game, and one of the most played video game in the world, developed by Riot Games.\r\n\r\nPlayers are tasked with teaming up with other players and squaring off against another team of players, typically in 5v5 matches. Three lanes connect a team’s base (or Nexus) to the other team’s base. Defensive measures for both teams also reside in each lane. Players choose a hero from over 120 Champions. Each character has its own skill set and abilities that help it excel in certain areas of the game. The key to winning matches is teamwork and solid reactions to enemy abilities. A strong understanding of the item meta game and what helps each particular champion is certainly desirable.\r\n\r\nPush each lane and try to take out your opponent’s defensive turrets (and their ever spawning creeps – small NPC minions that blindly move forward on each lane) and enemy champions on your way to taking out the enemy Nexus and scoring yourself a win.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, your champion will gain experience and gold and level up their abilities and allow you to purchase game items to modify your champion’s stats and performance.\r\n\r\nThese battles take place in two different game modes across a total of 4 available maps…although you’re probably only going to ever see one map unless you play in games against AI bot opponents.\r\n\r\nIn addition to in-game leveling and ranked matches each season, players also have modifiers on their profile through the use of Rune Pages. These pages allow players to “socket” Glyphs, Marks, Seals, and Quintessences to modify stats for you as the player. These modifications are then placed on any Champion you choose to play.\r\n\r\nMatchmaking in League of Legends is based primarily on your skill and past match performances. The automated system attempts to match competitors up with players of a similar skill level so as to avoid blowout matches.\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is often held up as the quintessential free-to-play model in that no aspect of gameplay (besides arguably additional rune pages even though they are not essential) is locked behind a cash shop purchase. The cash shop houses skins, cosmetics, and Champions and currency to purchase these items can be bought with real world money or farmed in-game.",

      "Smilegate’s free-to-play multiplayer ARPG is a massive adventure filled with lands waiting to be explored, people waiting to be met, and an ancient evil waiting to be destroyed. In Lost Ark, players enter the world of Arkesia and embark on a journey across several lands in a quest to locate the Ark of Legends. Stop the demon Kazeros and his army before they seize control. And hurry, the demons are searching for the Ark too.\r\n\r\nChoose to play as one of several classes ranging from the sword-wielding warrior to a mage or even the gunner – each with several advanced class options. Play alone or with friends (or acquaintances) to explore seven vast continents filled with strange cultures and creatures. Fight in PvP, explore dungeons, and work together in raids. Decide what you like to do best and go for it – but don’t forget to save the world.\r\n\r\nLost Ark offers an easy-to-learn system with plenty of room to customize. Use the game’s ‘Tripod’ system to unlock up to three tiers of customization for each ability and create the combat style that works best for you.\r\n\r\nAs for other features, Lost Ark offers crafting, guilds, and other systems players expect from online games. Whatever you want to do, it’s up to you.\r\n",

      "Get into the action in one of the longest running battle royale games PUBG Battlegrounds. Originally titled PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, the game has been offering players the full battle royale experience in a more realistic setting since 2017. Test yourself against 99 other players on seven different maps using whatever weapons you can find. Just be sure to be the last one standing, because that’s the only way to win.\r\n\r\nGo it alone or play with friends in groups of two or four. Start out with only the clothes on your back, loot buildings, towns, and other locations to obtain the equipment you need. This includes weapons, armor, vehicles, and more. If you want the really good gear – and it’s likely you do – you’ll have to take some risks and head to the more dangerous zones on the map.\r\n\r\nAs is generally the case with the battle royale formula, PUBG’s map shrinks over time, herding all players into a random location where they will eventually have no choice but to engage each other or risk taking damage outside the restricted area. At the same time, random areas of the map will be bombed. So, players must be aware of both events and do their best to avoid them.\r\n\r\nPUBG Battlegrounds is free-to-play and offers players purchasable items in the form of cosmetics. These do not impact game play.\r\n",
