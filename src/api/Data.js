      "The demon fighting doesn’t have to stop when you walk away from the computer thanks to Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo Immortal. Built for mobile and also released on PC, the game fills in the gaps between Diablo II and III in an MMOARPG environment.\r\n\r\nDiablo Immortal picks up following the presumed death of the Archangel Tyrael, during which time mankind must deal with the fallout. One of the many problems are the fragments of the shattered Worldstone spread across the land, waiting for Diablo’s underlings to collect them in an attempt to bring about his return.\r\n\r\nPlayers can choose from one of six classes in Diablo Immortal. These are the classic Barbarian, the Crusader, the Demon Hunter, the Monk, the Necromancer, and the Wizard. All six classes features their own unique skills and abilities.\r\n\r\nThe game also introduces six new bosses, ranging from The Skeleton King to the Glacial Colossus. Each offers players a unique challenge, and all are found in places filled with danger. So, players will want to be well prepared before taking them on.\r\n",

      "Smilegate’s free-to-play multiplayer ARPG is a massive adventure filled with lands waiting to be explored, people waiting to be met, and an ancient evil waiting to be destroyed. In Lost Ark, players enter the world of Arkesia and embark on a journey across several lands in a quest to locate the Ark of Legends. Stop the demon Kazeros and his army before they seize control. And hurry, the demons are searching for the Ark too.\r\n\r\nChoose to play as one of several classes ranging from the sword-wielding warrior to a mage or even the gunner – each with several advanced class options. Play alone or with friends (or acquaintances) to explore seven vast continents filled with strange cultures and creatures. Fight in PvP, explore dungeons, and work together in raids. Decide what you like to do best and go for it – but don’t forget to save the world.\r\n\r\nLost Ark offers an easy-to-learn system with plenty of room to customize. Use the game’s ‘Tripod’ system to unlock up to three tiers of customization for each ability and create the combat style that works best for you.\r\n\r\nAs for other features, Lost Ark offers crafting, guilds, and other systems players expect from online games. Whatever you want to do, it’s up to you.\r\n",

      "Get into the action in one of the longest running battle royale games PUBG Battlegrounds. Originally titled PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, the game has been offering players the full battle royale experience in a more realistic setting since 2017. Test yourself against 99 other players on seven different maps using whatever weapons you can find. Just be sure to be the last one standing, because that’s the only way to win.\r\n\r\nGo it alone or play with friends in groups of two or four. Start out with only the clothes on your back, loot buildings, towns, and other locations to obtain the equipment you need. This includes weapons, armor, vehicles, and more. If you want the really good gear – and it’s likely you do – you’ll have to take some risks and head to the more dangerous zones on the map.\r\n\r\nAs is generally the case with the battle royale formula, PUBG’s map shrinks over time, herding all players into a random location where they will eventually have no choice but to engage each other or risk taking damage outside the restricted area. At the same time, random areas of the map will be bombed. So, players must be aware of both events and do their best to avoid them.\r\n\r\nPUBG Battlegrounds is free-to-play and offers players purchasable items in the form of cosmetics. These do not impact game play.\r\n",
